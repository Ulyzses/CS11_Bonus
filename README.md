# CS 11 Bonus Machine Exercises

### Bonus ME 1: Multiple Choice Quiz

This is a multiple choice adaptation of our previously done quiz exercise. The theme for this is heavily inspired by Cards Against Humanity.

Do not judge the content, the activity requires us to adapt our previous exercise, which involved me doing Teemo stuff. The original version of this can be found [here](https://me7.ulyzses.repl.co)

#### How to Use

In the site, there are 2 types of cards: black cards which display questions, and white cards which are the options. For each question, select an answer which you think is correct. A submit option will appear upon your selected answer. Clicking submit will register your answer and will check if it's correct or not. At the end, the number of correct items you have will be counted and displayed. You may opt to retake the test from then, which will reset everything.

### Bonus ME 2: Image Slider

This is a simple image slider for a 5 panel story. The story I used was the poem me and  my friend made back in Grade 6, hence the randomness. All art was done by me.

#### How to Use

Click the arrows to switch images. When you're at the final panel, clicking the next arrow will loop you back to the first image.
